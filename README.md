# PHP registration and login form with CSS and JS Animations
It is a registration and login form with a double slider animation made in CSS and JS.
It works with a mysql Db
I have added the .sql file with the created tables.
The database Connection details are in dbcon.php

What does it include ?
----------
A Remind Me Password with Cookies for password reminder.
A login failed error if the username and password is incorrect.
A password Error if the Password don't have minimum of 8 characters with at least 1 number and one uppercase and one lowercase character.
Invalid email! if the email is not a valid email.
Email Exists! : If the email is already registered.
Passwords are not matching!: If the password does not match.

When you login ir register It also links to a home.php page in wich will appear a welcome message to the username and a logout link that kill the session and comes back to the main Registration form.
